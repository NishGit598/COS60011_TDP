# COS60011_TDP – Cardiovascular Disease Informatics Dashboard

Welcome to the repository for our COS60011 TDP Group Project.  
This project explores cardiovascular disease (CVD) trends in Australia by integrating public health datasets, machine learning models, and interactive data visualizations.

## Project Overview

Our goal was to uncover behavioral risk patterns and predict cardiovascular risk across Australian states using data science tools. The solution is built on a pipeline of:

- Python-based data cleaning and modeling
- Machine learning models (Linear Regression & K-Means Clustering)
- Interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI
